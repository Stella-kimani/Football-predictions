You have been recruited as a football analyst in a company - Mchezopesa Ltd and tasked to accomplish the task below.

A prediction result of a game between team 1 and team 2, based on who's home and who's away, and on whether or not the game is friendly (include rank in your training).

You have two possible approaches (as  shown below) given the datasets that will be provided

Input: Home team, Away team, Tournament type (World cup, Friendly, Other)

Approach 1: Polynomial approach

What to train given:

Rank of home team
Rank of away team
Tournament type
Model 1: Predict how many goals the home team scores.

Model 2: Predict how many goals the away team scores.

Approach 2: Logistic approach

Feature Engineering: Figure out from the home teamâ€™s perspective if the game is a Win, Lose or Draw (W, L, D)
